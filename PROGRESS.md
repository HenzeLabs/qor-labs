## Notes & Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Reason |
|------|----------|--------|
| 2026-02-05 | Keep Dawn's base.css alongside new theme.css | Gradual migration avoids breaking existing functionality while we build new Rapha-inspired sections |
| 2026-02-05 | Use Google Fonts instead of Shopify font picker | Design system specifies exact fonts (Instrument Serif + DM Sans) that aren't in Shopify's font library |
